## Problem Statement
According to the WHO, cardiovascular diseases are one of the top killers in the world. About 17 million people die every year because of cardiovascular disease, especially heart disease. 

## Objective
To analyze and create a model for predicting heart disease.

## Dataset
The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) contains 14 columns which describe patients medical information such as -
  - age : age in years
  - sex : (1 = male; 0 = female)
  - cp : chest pain type
  - trestbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
  - chol : serum cholestoral in mg/dl
  - fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
  - restecg : resting electrocardiographic results
  - thalach : maximum heart rate achieved
  - exang : exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
  - oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
  - slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
  - ca : number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
  - thal : 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
  - target : 1 or 0
